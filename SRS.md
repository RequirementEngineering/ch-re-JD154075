  Line 1|  Developers: |What is the goal of these project?	   |
  Line 2|  `Laboratory Director:` |`I need a software program that can register the sing in's and out's of students that are in the work program and social program, also to register the faculty that is involved.`	   |
  Line 3|  Developers: |What problem does it solve?	   |
  Line 4|  `Laboratory Director:` |`It will atomize the productivity of how we register, otherwise it would have to be inputted manually, and that takes time.`	   |
  Line 5|  Developers: |Who will use it?	   |
  Line 6|  `Laboratory Director:` |`I would be using it, if not me, it would be a personal that I assign. Also the students and faculty who will be sing in and out.`	   |
  Line 7|  Developers: |What should the software program do?	   |
  Line 8|  `Laboratory Director:` |`I need the program to register in a database, the sing in's and out's of students and faculty.`	   |
  Line 9|  Developers: |What is the domain we need to understand?	   |
  Line 10|  `Laboratory Director:` |`Database registry and it's exportation.`	   |
  Line 11|  Developers: |What are the specifics feature will it need to have?	   |
  Line 12|  `Laboratory Director:` |`I also need it to register that data with a barcode scanner.I also need it to produce a weekly report sent to my email of who sing in,if not posible. I just need it to produce report that can be selected either by date (with in a date range),student ID or name and or all files in that database, I also need it to be shareable on a tablet for portability,if possible.`	   |
  Line 13|  Developers: |Which platforms do you need it to be available on?	   |
  Line 14|  `Laboratory Director:` |`None in specification.`	   |
  Line 16|  Developers: |What other parties integrate with the software program?   |
  Line 17|  `Laboratory Director:` |`Barcode scanner and excel for exportation.`	   |

>Second Meeting Interview: Type: **Conversation**

Line Number|  Actors	   |  <br>|  
 --- | --- | --- | 
  Line 1|  Developers: |Hello, Ok so what we have to show for you, is the software program's interface and an SQL database, wich neither of them are interconnected  yet.	   |
  Line 2|  `Laboratory Director:` |`Ok, I like it.`	   |
  Line 3|  Developers: |We were exchanging ideas on how to do it, and we both concluded that this program has to be on a local database, since an online server is not the best option for what the program is being asked to do. It would be depend on third parties.There is also the problem that we would have to pay for the server, and since this program is for the school, it is not possible. As for a local server,we would have to monopolies a computer system ,which would have to be on 24/7.   |
  Line 4|  Developers: |There are free server, but there may be the occasion that the online server falls and that's independable.	   |
  Line 5|  Developers: |So we do not think we can give you a software program that can be used on a tablet.	   |
  Line 6|  `Laboratory Director:` |`Oh Ok, I understand.So a better idea would be, making the software program installable on a stand alone machine,which would be my computer, do you think you can make that database sharable with its own program on another stand alone machine ? `	   |
  Line 7|  Developers: |We think it's possible,will se what we can do .	   |
  Line 8|  Developers: |Ok,That's all we got for now, to show you.	   |
  Line 9|  `Laboratory Director:` |`Ok guys, I like what you have so far, keep up the good work .`	   |
  Line 10|  Developers: |Ok,thank you,see you next time.	   |
  Line 11|  `Laboratory Director:` |`Ok then, till then.`	   |

 --- | --- | --- | 
  Line 1|  Developers: |Hello again, Ok so what we have to show for you today, is that the software program's interface and an SQL database are now interconnected. You can register and consult through the interface and the call to the registry in the SQL database will be made.	   |
  Line 2|  `Laboratory Director:` |`Ok, can we test it`	   |
  Line 3|  Developers: |Of course	   |
  Line 4|  `Laboratory Director:` |`I like what I see`	   |
  Line 5|  `Laboratory Director:` |`Can you add an option where the registry can be modifiable through the interfce.`	   |
  Line 6|  Developers: |Do you jus want to modify the registrations in the registry or what else do you want it to have.  	   |
  Line 7|  `Laboratory Director:` |`What I would have like it to have, is a delete option aswell, the reason being is that their are students and faculty that either they finish their work and don't have to come back or for what ever reason just have to be deleted. `	   |
   Line 8|  `Laboratory Director:` |`I would also like for the program to have an option or a button to export the report in a excel file `	   |
  Line 9|  Developers: |Of course we can do that, wil the exported file in excel have a templet with the school logo?	   |
  Line 10|  `Laboratory Director:` |`Yes, I would like that, it would also have a sing off section to make the report oficial `	   |
  Line 11|  Developers: |Ok, we can do that.Will give you a new revision next time. 	   |
  Line 12|  `Laboratory Director:` |`Yes,ok guys I will see you next time. `	   |

 --- | --- | --- | 
  Line 1|  Developers: |Hello, Ok so what we have to show for you today, is that software program can modify,delete in the database registry through the interface,and it can export a report to an excel temple preformatted with the school logo and title showing what the report is about. 	   |
  Line 2|  `Laboratory Director:` |`It's looking good.Will the modification option have a lock(sign in) restriction so that no student or facutly member can make a modification to the registry with out my authorization.  `	   |
  Line 3|  `Laboratory Director:` |`Can the interface be divide in to two sections, the students registry and faculty registry sense that the faculty registry involves the use of laboratories and equipment.     `	   |
  Line 4|  Developers: |Yes we will work on it. 	   |
